If washing is desired though, all wool garments should be kept out of a top loading washing machine. In a front loader you may wash turned inside out, in a mesh bag, on a cold gentle cycle with a slow spin finish. Otherwise hand wash. Lay flat to dry.\nOver time if pilling occurs, you may use a sweater shaver as directed to maintain a clean new look.","creation_tsz":1535037226,"ending_tsz":1545581626,"original_creation_tsz":1347900603,"last_modified_tsz":1535037226,"price":"100.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":9,"sku":[],"tags":["organic leggings","wool tights","wool leggings","Organic clothing","wine red leggings","Womens clothing","organic merino wool","woolen moss","soft wool","leggings","Running leggings","cold yoga activewear","eileen fisher like"],"category_path":["Clothing","Women","Pants"],"category_path_ids":[69150353,69152559,68930920],"materials":["organic merino wool"],"shop_section_id":14336008,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1512090986,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/109715293\/organic-clothing-leggings-organic-merino?utm_source=iwouldlike&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":13821,"num_favorers":779,"shipping_template_id":111700678,"processing_min":10,"processing_max":15,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"women","occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":false,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":510,"taxonomy_path":["Clothing","Women's Clothing","Leggings"],"used_manufacturer":false},{"listing_id":604254674,"state":"active","user_id":5179166,"category_id":69195163,"title":"Women&#39;s vintage 1980&#39;s HI TEC hiking boots\/shoes.
